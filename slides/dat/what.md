# DAT

### Powers of dat + beaker <!-- .slide: data-background-image="./img/beaker.png" -->

- simple to use (esp with Beaker)
- apis are simple and to the point [good docs](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat)
- versioned: trivial to access previous versions of an archive
- truely decentralized
- different flavours: Beaker, CLI etc
- not too technical (more accessible than Git & co)
  
### Ease of sharing

- jscad designs are code: files & folders
- dat good at ...sharing the above
- ability to listen to changes to dat archives in almost real time
- like a match in decentralized heaven ?
